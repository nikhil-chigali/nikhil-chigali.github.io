I’m Nikhil, an aspiring ML engineer who enjoys designing and shipping end‑to‑end AI systems—not just training models in a notebook. My interests currently revolve around large language models, parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning, and real‑time, production‑ready ML pipelines.

Before transitioning toward ML engineering, I spent several years as a project manager at Microsoft, working on large‑scale Azure projects with a strong focus on cost optimization, metrics, and data‑driven decision making. That experience taught me how to think about systems, constraints, and impact—skills I now apply when designing and deploying ML solutions.

I enjoy taking ideas from papers or blogs, implementing them, and then pushing them all the way to something that can be demoed, monitored, and iterated on.

This site collects my projects, experiments, paper summaries, and notes. If you’re interested in collaborating, discussing LLM systems, or just geeking out about MLOps and infra, feel free to reach out.
